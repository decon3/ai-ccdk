You are working on the current project. Plan and execute refactoring based on the user's request "$ARGUMENTS" using direct analysis without sub-agents.

## Direct Refactoring Approach

### Step 1: Analyze Current State
Based on the user's request "$ARGUMENTS", examine:
- Current implementation and architecture
- Code quality and maintainability issues
- Dependencies and integration points
- Test coverage and existing tests

### Step 2: Define Refactoring Goals
Identify specific objectives:
- What needs to be improved (performance, readability, maintainability)
- What patterns should be applied
- What technical debt should be addressed
- What new requirements need to be supported

### Step 3: Impact Assessment
Evaluate the scope of changes:
- Which files will be modified
- What dependencies will be affected
- What tests need to be updated
- What documentation needs revision

### Step 4: Refactoring Strategy
Plan the refactoring approach:
- Break down complex changes into smaller steps
- Identify safe transformation patterns
- Plan for backward compatibility if needed
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout

### Step 5: Implementation Plan
Create a detailed plan including:
- Order of operations (dependencies first)
- File-by-file changes needed
- Test updates required
- Documentation updates
- Validation steps

### Step 6: Risk Mitigation
Address potential risks:
- Identify potential breaking changes
- Plan rollback strategy
- Consider performance implications
- Validate against project standards

### Step 7: Execute Refactoring
Implement the changes following the plan:
- Make incremental changes
- Verify each step maintains functionality
- Update tests as needed
- Update documentation
- Follow project coding standards

Now proceed with the direct refactoring analysis and implementation based on the user's request.
