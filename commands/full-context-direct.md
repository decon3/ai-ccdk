You are working on the current project. Analyze and respond to the user's request "$ARGUMENTS" using direct analysis without sub-agents.

## Auto-Loaded Project Context:
@/CLAUDE.md
@/docs/ai-context/project-structure.md
@/docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md

## Direct Analysis Approach

### Step 1: Understand the Request
Analyze the user's request "$ARGUMENTS" to determine:
- What specific information they need
- Which parts of the codebase are most relevant
- What level of detail is appropriate

### Step 2: Gather Relevant Context
Based on the auto-loaded project context and your understanding of the request:

1. **Review Auto-Loaded Documentation**
   - Use the project structure to understand the codebase layout
   - Check the docs overview to find relevant additional documentation
   - Apply coding standards and patterns from CLAUDE.md

2. **Identify Key Areas**
   - Use the project structure to locate relevant files/directories
   - Focus on areas most likely to contain the information needed
   - Consider dependencies and integration points

3. **Examine Implementation**
   - Read relevant source files directly
   - Look for patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
   - Check configuration files and setup scripts

### Step 3: Analyze and Synthesize
Provide a comprehensive response by:
- Combining information from documentation and code
- Explaining architectural decisions and patterns
- Highlighting important dependencies and relationships
- Suggesting improvements or next steps if relevant

### Step 4: Provide Actionable Information
Structure your response to include:
- Clear explanation of findings
- Specific file references and code examples
- Recommendations following project conventions
- Next steps or areas for further investigation

Now proceed with analyzing the user's request directly using the available tools and auto-loaded context.
